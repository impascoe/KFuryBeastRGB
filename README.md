## DISCLAIMER: This may break your memory as this code directly changes memory addresses. Proceed at your own risk.

This is a script that changes the RGB LEDs on the memory sticks.
To be specific, this code as far as I know, only works with my memory and I have not tested with any other Kingston Fury RGB DDR5 kits.

This is my memory:
Kingston KF560C36-16 x 4
